###The Zero-Waste Chef üç≥
Transform your leftovers into delicious meals and fight food waste with our smart recipe finder. This project is a direct response to the challenge of reducing household food waste through accessible technology.

###How We Promote Environmental Sustainability ‚ôªÔ∏è
This project directly addresses the challenge: "How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"

Our answer is The Zero-Waste Chef. We provide a simple, technology-driven tool that empowers users to make sustainable choices every day. By helping people cook with the ingredients they already have, our app:

Actively Promotes Resourcefulness: It encourages a shift in consumer behaviour from "what do I want to buy?" to "what can I make with what I have?".

Reduces Landfill Waste: Directly cuts down on the amount of food discarded from households, which is a major contributor to methane emissions from landfills.

Fosters Greener Communities: By providing a practical solution for individual households, we collectively build a more sustainable community from the ground up.

###The Problem
A significant portion of household waste is food. Perfectly good ingredients are often thrown away simply because we lack inspiration or don't know how to combine what's left in the fridge. This wastes money and places a heavy burden on our environment.

###Our Solution
The Zero-Waste Chef is a smart kitchen assistant that suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. You input what you need to use up, and the app provides a list of delicious recipes, turning potential waste into a meal.

###Key Features (Hackathon MVP)
Ingredient-Based Search: Enter 2-3 ingredients you want to use.

Instant Recipe Suggestions: Get a list of matching recipes from a vast online database.

Simple & Clean Interface: A user-friendly design focused on getting you cooking quickly, without any clutter.

How It Works
Input: Enter the ingredients you have (e.g., "Tomatoes, Onions, Eggs").

Search: The app makes an API call to find matching recipes.

Discover: Browse the list of suggested recipes with titles and images.

Cook: Click a recipe to view the instructions and enjoy your zero-waste meal!

###Tech Stack
Frontend: A clean and simple web interface (e.g., built with React, Vue, or Svelte).

Backend/API: Integration with the Spoonacular Recipe API.
